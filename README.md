# Abinito_Hackathon
This was a ML Hackathon organized by SRMIST, Chennai. 

Problem Statement :
AI and Data Usage in Healthcare 

AI models used in healthcare are built on previous data. But, when both medical  knowledge and treatment are biased and used as data fed into AI models, we end up with AI that exacerbates current and past issues and prejudices within healthcare. How can we make sure AI models account for biased data?
